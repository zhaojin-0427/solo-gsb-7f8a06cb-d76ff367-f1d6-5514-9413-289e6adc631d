"""SQLite-backed registry: nonces and ordered per-stream events.

A nonce is registered with a single ``INSERT``; the ``PRIMARY KEY``
constraint makes the registration atomic under concurrent writers. A
nonce that has already been consumed (and committed) is rejected as a
replay. A failed signature check never inserts anything, so failed
attempts do not consume a nonce.

Stream events are stored per ``(stream_id, sequence)``. Each stream has a
high-water mark: only events whose sequence is contiguous from 1 up to
the mark are "ready". Events ahead of a gap are buffered and become
visible in one atomic jump when the gap is filled. Nonce registration,
event insertion and the watermark update happen inside a single
``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction, so concurrent commits can never open the
same sequence twice.

On top of the watermark each stream keeps a *confirmed* cursor: the
highest sequence already consumed and acknowledged in order. Claim/ack
hand out the single next event ("confirmed + 1", never past the
watermark) under a short-lived lease held in the same database, so the
in-flight sequence, its random token and its expiry all survive a
process restart. Claim and ack each run inside ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``,
which serialises concurrent consumers.

Finally each stream keeps a *compaction* bound ``compacted_until``: the
highest confirmed prefix that has been deleted to reclaim space. The
bound only moves forward and never past ``confirmed_seq``; advancing it
and deleting the bound's events are one ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` write
transaction, serialised against event ingestion, claim and ack. Reads
run inside a single deferred transaction, so they always see one
consistent snapshot of the bound, the watermark and the events.

Every opened event additionally carries a link of a SHA-256 *integrity
chain* (see :mod:`app.integrity`): when a gap is filled and a run of
sequences opens, each link is computed in sequence order from the
previous digest (32 zero bytes for the chain's first link) and the
canonical JSON of the ``[stream_id, sequence, data]`` array. Events
merely buffered behind a gap get no digest. When a prefix is compacted
the digest *at* the new bound is atomically retained as the chain
anchor, so later writes and checks continue from it.

Two kinds of older databases are upgraded at startup, both without
touching events, nonces, leases, watermarks or consumption progress:

* databases created before integrity chaining existed get their
  retained, already-open events chained from the existing compaction
  bound using a zero anchor;
* databases holding chains in the legacy *object* link encoding are
  verified link by link and then re-encoded to the array encoding
  inside a single write transaction (a zero-digest anchor is placed at
  the compaction bound of already-compacted streams, whose deleted
  prefix can no longer be recomputed). A legacy chain that fails
  verification is never silently rewritten: startup aborts with
  :class:`ChainCorruptionError` instead. The migration commits the
  recomputed digests and the ``digest_format`` marker atomically, so an
  interrupted migration is simply retried in full on the next start.
